- **Summary**: The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages -- including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the 2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people. While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+ speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06% (MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices' potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

- **Summary**: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is constrained.

- **Summary**: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications. This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection, self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical, efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic participation for speakers of African languages.

<summary><strong>AfroXLMR-Social: Adapting Pre-trained Language Models for African
  Languages Social Media Text</strong> by Tadesse Destaw Belay, Israel Abebe Azime, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Idris Abdulmumin, Abinew Ali Ayele, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Seid Muhie Yimam</summary>

- **Summary**: Language models built from various sources are the foundation of today's NLP progress. However, for many low-resource languages, the diversity of domains is often limited -- more biased to a religious domain, which impacts their performance when evaluated on distant and rapidly evolving domains such as social media. Domain adaptive pre-training (DAPT) and task-adaptive pre-training (TAPT) are popular techniques to reduce this bias through continual pre-training for BERT-based models, but they have not been explored for African multilingual encoders. In this paper, we explore DAPT and TAPT continual pertaining approaches for the African languages social media domain. We introduce AfriSocial-a large-scale social media and news domain corpus for continual pre-training on several African languages. Leveraging AfriSocial, we show that DAPT consistently improves performance on three subjective tasks: sentiment analysis, multi-label emotion, and hate speech classification, covering 19 languages from 1% to 30% F1 score. Similarly, leveraging TAPT on one task data improves performance on other related tasks. For example, training with unlabeled sentiment data (source) for a fine-grained emotion classification task (target) improves the baseline results by an F1 score ranging from 0.55% to 15.11%. Combining these two methods (i.e. DAPT + TAPT) further improves the overall performance.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the Esethu Framework, a sustainable data curation framework specifically designed to empower local communities and ensure equitable benefit-sharing from their linguistic resources. This framework is supported by the Esethu license, a novel community-centric data license. As a proof of concept, we introduce the Vuk'uzenzele isiXhosa Speech Dataset (ViXSD), an open-source corpus developed under the Esethu Framework and License. The dataset, containing read speech from native isiXhosa speakers enriched with demographic and linguistic metadata, demonstrates how community-driven licensing and curation principles can bridge resource gaps in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages while safeguarding the interests of data creators. We describe the framework guiding dataset development, outline the Esethu license provisions, present the methodology for ViXSD, and present ASR experiments validating ViXSD's usability in building and refining voice-driven applications for isiXhosa.

<summary><strong>Speech to Speech Translation with Translatotron: A State of the Art

- **Summary**: A cascade-based speech-to-speech translation has been considered a benchmark for a very long time, but it is plagued by many issues, like the time taken to translate a speech from one language to another and compound errors. These issues are because a cascade-based method uses a combination of methods such as speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and finally, text-to-speech translation. Translatotron, a sequence-to-sequence direct speech-to-speech translation model was designed by Google to address the issues of compound errors associated with cascade model. Today there are 3 versions of the Translatotron model: Translatotron 1, Translatotron 2, and Translatotron3. The first version was designed as a proof of concept to show that a direct speech-to-speech translation was possible, it was found to be less effective than the cascade model but was producing promising results. Translatotron2 was an improved version of Translatotron 1 with results similar to the cascade model. Translatotron 3 the latest version of the model is better than the cascade model at some points. In this paper, a complete review of speech-to-speech translation will be presented, with a particular focus on all the versions of Translatotron models. We will also show that Translatotron is the best model to bridge the language gap between African Languages and other well-formalized languages.

<summary><strong>Building low-resource African language corpora: A case study of
  Kidawida, Kalenjin and Dholuo</strong> by Audrey Mbogho, Quin Awuor, Andrew Kipkebut, Lilian Wanzare, Vivian Oloo</summary>

- **Summary**: Natural Language Processing is a crucial frontier in artificial intelligence, with broad applications in many areas, including public health, agriculture, education, and commerce. However, due to the lack of substantial linguistic resources, many African languages remain underrepresented in this digital transformation. This paper presents a case study on the development of linguistic corpora for three under-resourced Kenyan languages, Kidaw'ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo, with the aim of advancing natural language processing and linguistic research in African communities. Our project, which lasted one year, employed a selective crowd-sourcing methodology to collect text and speech data from native speakers of these languages. Data collection involved (1) recording conversations and translation of the resulting text into Kiswahili, thereby creating parallel corpora, and (2) reading and recording written texts to generate speech corpora. We made these resources freely accessible via open-research platforms, namely Zenodo for the parallel text corpora and Mozilla Common Voice for the speech datasets, thus facilitating ongoing contributions and access for developers to train models and develop Natural Language Processing applications. The project demonstrates how grassroots efforts in corpus building can support the inclusion of African languages in artificial intelligence innovations. In addition to filling resource gaps, these corpora are vital in promoting linguistic diversity and empowering local communities by enabling Natural Language Processing applications tailored to their needs. As African countries like Kenya increasingly embrace digital transformation, developing indigenous language resources becomes essential for inclusive growth. We encourage continued collaboration from native speakers and developers to expand and utilize these corpora.

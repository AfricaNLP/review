The AFRIDOC-MT paper introduces a new multi-parallel translation dataset for English and five African languages, focusing on health and technology documents. It evaluates various neural machine translation models, finding that fine-tuning enhances performance but models trained on sentences struggle with longer documents. Large language models, such as NLLB-200 and GPT-4o, show strong translation capabilities, especially when fine-tuned, but face challenges like under-generation and off-target translations in African languages. The study emphasizes the need for improved evaluation metrics and broader language coverage, highlighting advancements in machine translation, language models, and multilingual evaluation. Performance results are presented for various models, including LLaMAX3, LLama3.1, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4o, using metrics like BLEU and CHRF to assess translation quality across different domains and languages.

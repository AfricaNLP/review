<summary><strong>AI-Driven Climate Policy Scenario Generation for Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> by Rafiu Adekoya Badekale, Adewale Akinfaderin</summary>

- **Published**: May 24, 2025 at 01:38 PM UTC  
- **PDF**: [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18694v1)  
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.18694v1  
- **Summary**: Climate policy scenario generation and evaluation have traditionally relied on integrated assessment models (IAMs) and expert-driven qualitative analysis. These methods enable stakeholders, such as policymakers and researchers, to anticipate impacts, plan governance strategies, and develop mitigation measures. However, traditional methods are often time-intensive, reliant on simple extrapolations of past trends, and limited in capturing the complex and interconnected nature of energy and climate issues. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI models trained on vast datasets, these limitations can be addressed, ensuring robustness even under limited data conditions. In this work, we explore the novel method that employs generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to simulate climate policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. These scenarios focus on energy transition themes derived from the historical United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) documents. By leveraging generative models, the project aims to create plausible and diverse policy scenarios that align with regional climate goals and energy challenges. Given limited access to human evaluators, automated techniques were employed for scenario evaluation. We generated policy scenarios using the llama3.2-3B model. Of the 34 generated responses, 30 (88%) passed expert validation, accurately reflecting the intended impacts provided in the corresponding prompts. We compared these validated responses against assessments from a human climate expert and two additional LLMs (gemma2-2B and mistral-7B). Our structured, embedding-based evaluation framework shows that generative AI effectively generate scenarios that are coherent, relevant, plausible, and diverse. This approach offers a transformative tool for climate policy planning in data-constrained regions.

<summary><strong>Voice of a Continent: Mapping Africa's Speech Technology Frontier</strong> by AbdelRahim Elmadany, Sang Yun Kwon, Hawau Olamide Toyin, Alcides Alcoba Inciarte, Hanan Aldarmaki, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</summary>

- **Published**: May 24, 2025 at 12:11 AM UTC  
- **PDF**: [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18436v1)  
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.18436v1  
- **Summary**: Africa's rich linguistic diversity remains significantly underrepresented in speech technologies, creating barriers to digital inclusion. To alleviate this challenge, we systematically map the continent's speech space of datasets and technologies, leading to a new comprehensive benchmark SimbaBench for downstream African speech tasks. Using SimbaBench, we introduce the Simba family of models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple African languages and speech tasks. Our benchmark analysis reveals critical patterns in resource availability, while our model evaluation demonstrates how dataset quality, domain diversity, and language family relationships influence performance across languages. Our work highlights the need for expanded speech technology resources that better reflect Africa's linguistic diversity and provides a solid foundation for future research and development efforts toward more inclusive speech technologies.

<summary><strong>An Explorative Analysis of SVM Classifier and ResNet50 Architecture on
  African Food Classification</strong> by Chinedu Emmanuel Mbonu, Kenechukwu Anigbogu, Doris Asogwa, Tochukwu Belonwu</summary>

- **Published**: May 20, 2025 at 04:37 AM UTC  
- **PDF**: [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13923v1)  
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.13923v1  
- **Summary**: Food recognition systems has advanced significantly for Western cuisines, yet its application to African foods remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by evaluating both deep learning and traditional machine learning methods for African food classification. We compared the performance of a fine-tuned ResNet50 model with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset comprises 1,658 images across six selected food categories that are known in Africa. To assess model effectiveness, we utilize five key evaluation metrics: Confusion matrix, F1-score, accuracy, recall and precision. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches, contributing to the advancement of food recognition for African cuisines.

<summary><strong>Unequal Journeys to Food Markets: Continental-Scale Evidence from Open
  Data in Africa</strong> by Robert Benassai-Dalmau, Vasiliki Voukelatou, Rossano Schifanella, Stefania Fiandrino, Daniela Paolotti, Kyriaki Kalimeri</summary>

- **Published**: May 12, 2025 at 01:43 PM UTC  
- **PDF**: [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07913v1)  
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.07913v1  
- **Summary**: Food market accessibility is a critical yet underexplored dimension of food systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we present a continent-wide assessment of spatial food market accessibility in Africa, integrating open geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and the World Food Programme. We compare three complementary metrics: travel time to the nearest market, market availability within a 30-minute threshold, and an entropy-based measure of spatial distribution, to quantify accessibility across diverse settings. Our analysis reveals pronounced disparities: rural and economically disadvantaged populations face substantially higher travel times, limited market reach, and less spatial redundancy. These accessibility patterns align with socioeconomic stratification, as measured by the Relative Wealth Index, and moderately correlate with food insecurity levels, assessed using the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Overall, results suggest that access to food markets plays a relevant role in shaping food security outcomes and reflects broader geographic and economic inequalities. This framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for identifying underserved regions and supporting equitable infrastructure planning and policy design across diverse African contexts.

<summary><strong>Analysis of the accuracy of GNSS inferred precipitable water vapour
  against that from a 210 GHz WVR at the H.E.S.S. site</strong> by Lott Frans, Michael Backes, Heino Falcke, Tiziana Venturi</summary>

- **Published**: May 08, 2025 at 03:33 PM UTC  
- **PDF**: [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05346v1)  
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.05346v1  
- **Summary**: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) site and the Gamsberg Mountain have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). The AMT is poised to observe at millimetre and possibly at submillimetre wavelengths. At these wavelengths, precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity during observations and therefore needs to be accurately assessed at the potential sites for the AMT. In order to investigate the PWV conditions for the AMT, identical Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations were installed and used to assess the PWV at the two potential sites. In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements by the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS station PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR) also installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34 mm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site pressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature ($\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison, the offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure were used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS station with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to reliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.

<summary><strong>A comparative analysis of GNSS-inferred precipitable water vapour at the
  potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope</strong> by Lott Frans, Michael Backes, Heino Falcke, Tiziana Venturi</summary>

- **Published**: May 08, 2025 at 02:59 PM UTC  
- **PDF**: [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05310v1)  
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.05310v1  
- **Summary**: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of antennas across the globe currently used to image super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at a frequency of 230 GHz. Since the release of the image of M87$^\ast$ in 2019 and, subsequently, that of Sgr A$^\ast$ in 2022 by the EHT collaboration, the focus has shifted to dynamically imaging SMBHs. This has led to a search for potential sites to extend and fill in the gaps within the EHT network. The Gamsberg Mountain and the H.E.S.S. site are both located within the Khomas highlands and have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). Precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity and noise from atmospheric emissions when observing at millimetre to sub-millimetre wavelengths. This study aims to establish the PWV content and the atmospheric transmission at 86, 230, and 345 GHz at the AMT potential sites using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived PWV data. Results show both sites have potential for observations at 86 and 230 GHz, with 345 GHz possible at the Gamsberg Mountain during winter. The overall median PWV of 14.27 mm and 9.25 mm was calculated at the H.E.S.S. site and the Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. The EHT window had PWV medians of 16.62 mm and 11.20 mm at the H.E.S.S. site and Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. Among the two sites, the Gamsberg Mountain had the lowest PWV conditions, therefore making it the most suitable site for the AMT.

- **Summary**: The Euclid survey aims to measure the spectroscopic redshift of emission-line galaxies by identifying the H$\,{\alpha}$ line in their slitless spectra. This method is sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio of the line, as noise fluctuations or other strong emission lines can be misidentified as H$\,{\alpha}$, depending on redshift. These effects lead to catastrophic redshift errors and the inclusion of interlopers in the sample. We forecast the impact of such redshift errors on galaxy clustering measurements. In particular, we study the effect of interloper contamination on the two-point correlation function (2PCF), the growth rate of structures, and the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameters. We analyze 1000 synthetic spectroscopic catalogues, the EuclidLargeMocks, designed to match the area and selection function of the Data Release 1 (DR1) sample. We estimate the 2PCF of the contaminated catalogues, isolating contributions from correctly identified galaxies and from interlopers. We explore different models with increasing complexity to describe the measured 2PCF at fixed cosmology. Finally, we perform a cosmological inference and evaluate the systematic error on the inferred $f\sigma_8$, $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and $\alpha_{\perp}$ values associated with different models. Our results demonstrate that a minimal modelling approach, which only accounts for an attenuation of the clustering signal regardless of the type of contaminants, is sufficient to recover the correct values of $f\sigma_8$, $\alpha_{\parallel}$, and $\alpha_{\perp}$ at DR1. The accuracy and precision of the estimated AP parameters are largely insensitive to the presence of interlopers. The adoption of a minimal model induces a 1%-3% systematic error on the growth rate of structure estimation, depending on the redshift. However, this error remains smaller than the statistical error expected for the Euclid DR1 analysis.

- **Summary**: We present the first results from long-term high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe II emission as a part of a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed with the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m telescope. The $V$-band, 5100 \r{A} continuum, and H$\beta$ broad emission line light curves were measured for a set of quasars for between dozens to more than a hundred epochs from May 2017 to July 2020. Accurate time lags between the variations of the H$\beta$ broad line fluxes and the optical continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from $17.0_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$ to $95.9_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$ days in the rest frame. The virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15 quasars, ranging between $0.50_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ and $19.17_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$ in units of $10^7 M_\odot$. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first reverberation analysis published. Of the rest, two objects have been the subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these that are only half as long as found in the earlier investigations, which had only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are consistent with the earlier findings in the sense that the time lag and the line width vary inversely consistent with virialization.
